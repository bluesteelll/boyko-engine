# Open questions for the owner

Difficulties, disputable calls and things I did not understand — written down as they arise so the
owner can read them later and weigh in, rather than finding them buried in a report after the
decision was already made.

> Russian version: [`ru/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](ru/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md). **This file is the source of
> truth**; editing either side updates the other in the same commit. See [`ru/README.md`](ru/README.md).

**Convention.** Newest first. Each item states the situation, the options, and what it blocks. An
item is marked `RESOLVED` with the date and the owner's decision rather than deleted — the record of
*why* a call was made outlives the call. Perf and architecture forks are decided without asking, with
numbers; what lands here is VALUES, SCOPE, and anything genuinely unclear.

## OPEN — Occlusion culling has no measurable perf claim in this repository

**Situation.** The VG corpus is a triangle-density instrument, deliberately recomposed at rung R0b′
to measure density rather than occlusion. Measured ceiling on it: **1 of 44 drawn instances at
`orbit_mid`** (the binding framing) and 11 of 31 at `approach_close`. A min-reduced HZB can only
reject instances that win zero pixels, so those are hard upper bounds — and they bound more than
occlusion, since an instance also wins zero pixels when it is sub-pixel.

So the HZB and two-pass occlusion work now in flight can be built correctly and gated for
correctness, but **no occlusion speed-up can be demonstrated on any content in this tree**.

**Options.** (a) Ship it correctness-gated with no perf claim, as rung R2d shipped structural —
honest, and leaves the claim unmade until content exists. (b) Add a scene with real depth complexity
(an interior, a street) as a *separate* perf fixture, kept out of the density corpus so the two
instruments cannot contaminate each other. (c) Accept the claim will be made by whatever project is
built on the engine, not by this repository.

**Blocks.** Nothing immediately — implementation proceeds either way. It decides what the rung's
header is allowed to say, and whether a new fixture is worth building.

## OPEN — K2: no Nanite baseline, so the campaign's goal is unfalsifiable as stated

**Situation.** The virtual-geometry campaign's kill criterion K2 requires a Nanite reference table.
It has never been produced (UE is not installed; I cannot install it — the flow requires accepting an
EULA and creating an account, which I must not do). K2's own text says an unproducible baseline
*forces a scope restatement*: an absolute target instead of a relative one.

**Options.** (a) Owner installs UE and produces the table. (b) Restate the goal against an absolute
target (frame time at a stated triangle count and error bound) and record K2 as taken by its own
escape hatch. (c) Leave deferred and keep the goal formally unfalsifiable.

**Blocks.** No rung is blocked. It decides whether the campaign can ever declare success.

**History.** Raised earlier and deferred by the owner. Recorded here so it stops being invisible.

## RESOLVED 2026-08-02 — Cross-frame occlusion soundness

**The worry was mine and it was misframed.** A previous-frame pyramid is indeed not conservative —
but only for a ONE-pass cull. In two-pass it is never the last word: soundness lives entirely in the
late pass, which tests against a pyramid built from THIS frame's depth. The early pass is an
*unverified heuristic* whose only job is to fill the depth buffer with a good occluder set; its
mistakes cost late-pass work and never cost geometry. The theorem quantifies over every possible
early-pass output, so nothing about the early pass has to be proven at all.

Confirmed against practice rather than assumed: UE5 Nanite, Assassin's Creed Unity (SIGGRAPH 2015),
Granite, Bevy 0.16 and Unity 6's GPU Resident Drawer all have this same structure.

Full statement and proof: [VG-R3-HZB-PLAN.md](VG-R3-HZB-PLAN.md) §1. **No owner decision needed.**

## OPEN — The HZB implementation design was REJECTED with 8 blockers

**Situation.** With soundness settled, the implementation design was reviewed and returned REJECTED
by both reviewers. The blockers are real, not stylistic — among them: the design revives
frustum-culled instances and thereby deletes rung R2d-6's arming; unknown mesh bounds produce a
PERMANENT false reject for any streaming-in mesh, surviving both passes; the one gate that can see a
false reject cannot be built as specified, because `vb_depth` carries no `TRANSFER_SRC` and the
readback path it depends on is listed UNVERIFIED while being load-bearing; and the pyramid build,
being compute, must split the VB raster's single dynamic-rendering scope in two, which the plan does
not address — a naive second scope would `LOAD_OP_CLEAR` away the early pass.

Full list: [VG-R3-HZB-PLAN.md](VG-R3-HZB-PLAN.md) §5.

**Options.** (a) One more design revision round against the 8 blockers, then implement — the same
loop that took rung R2d from 8 blockers to shipped. (b) Implement the uncontroversial foundation
first (S1 the RHI `TextureView`, S2 the framegraph guard, S3 the host oracle) while the cull design
is revised — these three are independently useful and none depends on the disputed parts.
(c) Park the rung.

**Blocks.** All HZB work. Nothing already shipped.

**Note.** Option (b) is what I would pick: S1 and S2 close real engine gaps that exist regardless of
whether occlusion culling is ever armed, and S3 is a host oracle that the eventual gates need.

## KNOWN FRICTIONS — no decision needed, recorded so they are not rediscovered

- **`target/` grows without bound and silently breaks builds.** It reached 73 GB and hit zero free
  space mid-build this session. The failure presents as a *mingw linker error*; the real cause is on
  the last line (`no space on device`). `cargo clean` recovered 73.6 GiB.
- **The trybuild test fails under a concurrent full-suite run** (`compile_fail_frame_write_token`,
  3/3 fixtures) and passes standalone. trybuild spawns its own cargo into the same `target`. Not a
  flake — reproducible contention.
- **graphify has been off-target for the render/VB path** for this entire session; every query
  returned `boyko_demo` internals. Grep/Read is the working path there.
- **`.claude/settings.local.json` is dirty** from earlier sessions and is deliberately never staged.
